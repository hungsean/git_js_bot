## Slash Command

there is a "SlashCommandBuilder" to let us build a slash command.
to use it, can add a .js like this:

```js
import {SlashCommandBuilder} from 'discord.js';

export default {
    command : new SlashCommandBuilder()
        .setName('test')
        .setDescription('Test command'),

    execute : async (interaction) => {
        await interaction.reply('Test command executed!');  
    }
}
```

inside, setName() and setDiscription() are necessary

interaction is more like "ctx" to let others read what the context about. Like this , it reads which channel to reply

## Extra

### export

you can use "export" to export a String, array, object, and function to let others inport

```js
export const String = "data";
export const array = [1, 2, 3];
export const object = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};
export const a_function = () => {return "Hello World!"};
```

and, if you want to set a default export,

```js
export default {
    //what you want to put
}
```

and import by this

```js
import {String, a_function} from './file'

console.log(String)

```

or this

```js
import data from './file'
// import default
```
