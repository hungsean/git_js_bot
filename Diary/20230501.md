## slash command request

if you want to add a slash command in your bot, you need to push an http request to discord.

you can just write by hand or using RUST

```js
import {REST, version, Routes} from "discord.js"


const updateSlashCommands = async(commands) =>{
    const rest = new REST({version: 10}).setToken(process.env.TOKEN)
    const result = await rest.put(
        Routes.applicationGuildCommands(
            process.env.APPLICATION_ID,
            '1095012848872210576'
            
        ),
        {
            body:commands,
        }
    )
    console.log(result)

}
```

import rest from discord.js, build a REST object and set token, put a request with routes, init, set application id and most important, your command body

how to find command body and put it into updateSlashCommands?

```js
import fg from 'fast-glob'

export const loadCommands = async() =>{

    const commands = []
    const files = await fg('./src/commands/**/index.js')
    for(const file of files)
    {
        const cmd = await import(file)
        commands.push(cmd.command)
    }

    await updateSlashCommands(commands)
}
```

here we using fast-glob to find commands we need to load. Then using for to find every file, inport to cmd, and push them to commands.

when its all ready, go into main, import loadCommands in loader.js, then using loadCommands() to load every commands, then, it is done.

## Extra

reply [20230423 #add-package-error](20230423.md#add-package-error), if that happpened, as usual, delete node_modules

but here, when reinstall the packages, you can use "yarn install"
